It's been a very hard year for our company, also as you know we are in Greece and since 2010 it's been very tough times for businesses. And the end of the year is always very hard financially with cashflows.

That's why i am asking for your understanding in price, so I can make an easier decision for my manager to decide.
Please if you can convince your own management to consider a generous discount it will help us in our decision with positive result. 
From our side we want our files faster and without loses than the options we have now. 
It seems that you can provide this service from the proof you sent.

"254","25","25","36","1","1735318612","Procedure for decrypting ESXi:
- log in to vCenter
- enable ssh access to ESXi
- upload decryptor to ESXi via WinSCP or FileZilla; navigate to /tmp folder
- login to ssh with root privileges
- set permissions to run the decryptor with the command - chmod 777 decrypt
- launch decryptor ./decrypt
- follow the first method of decrypting by viewing the log file: tail -f /tmp/decrypt.llg, wait for the message at the end of the log - Your system is decrypted
- the second way is to check the presence on the disk file decrypt.pid command ls, which protects the decryptor from the restart
- the third way - ps | grep decrypt, as soon as decrypt.pid will be removed from the disk, or decrypt will disappear from the running processes, decrypt is complete
- check the decrypt.llg log file and see the message at the end that the system was successfully decrypted  ""Your system is decrypted""
- turn on virtual machines in ESXi

You cannot run multiple copies of a decryptor at the same time. After launching, the decryptor deletes the executable file and is demonetized, so that you cannot run the decryptor again and damage the files, this is normal.

If you have more than one ESXi host then you should not run the decryptor on all hosts simultaneously, make the decryption alternately, in the case of simultaneous operation of two decryptors may corrupt files and not be able to decrypt

If any files in another folder stay crypted, please use this command with path
Example:

>>>>> What is the guarantee that we won't scam you? 
We are the oldest extortion gang on the planet and nothing is more important to us than our reputation. We are not a politically motivated group and want nothing but financial rewards for our work. If we defraud even one client, other clients will not pay us. In 5 years, not a single client has been left dissatisfied after making a deal with us. If you pay the ransom, we will fulfill all the terms we agreed upon during the negotiation process. Treat this situation simply as a paid training session for your system administrators, because it was the misconfiguration of your corporate network that allowed us to attack you. Our pentesting services should be paid for the same way you pay your system administrators' salaries. You can get more information about us on Elon Musk's Twitter at https://twitter.com/hashtag/lockbit?f=live.

>>>>> Warning! Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to irreversible problems with decryption of files!

>>>>> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help and don't tell anyone that we attacked you. They will forbid you from paying the ransom and will not help you in any way, you will be left with encrypted files and your business will die.

>>>>> When buying bitcoin, do not tell anyone the true purpose of the purchase. Some brokers, especially in the US, do not allow you to buy bitcoin to pay ransom. Communicate any other reason for the purchase, such as: personal investment in cryptocurrency, bitcoin as a gift, paying to buy assets for your business using bitcoin, cryptocurrency payment for consulting services, cryptocurrency payment for any other services, cryptocurrency donations, cryptocurrency donations for Donald Trump to win the election, buying bitcoin to participate in ICO and buy other cryptocurrencies, buying cryptocurrencies to leave an inheritance for your children, or any other purpose for buying cryptocurrency. Also you can use adequate cryptocurrency brokers who do not ask questions for what you buy cryptocurrency.

>>>>> After buying cryptocurrency from a broker, store the cryptocurrency on a cold wallet, such as https://electrum.org/ or any other cold cryptocurrency wallet, more details on https://bitcoin.org By paying the ransom from your personal cold cryptocurrency wallet, you will avoid any problems from regulators, police and brokers.

>>>>> Don't be afraid of any legal consequences, you were very scared, that's why you followed all our instructions, it's not your fault if you are very scared. Not a single company that paid us has had issues. Any excuses are just for insurance company to not pay on their obligation.

"1359","25","25","158","1","1739464633","Procedure for decrypting ESXi:
- log in to vCenter
- enable ssh access to ESXi
- upload decryptor to ESXi via WinSCP or FileZilla; navigate to /tmp folder
- login to ssh with root privileges
- set permissions to run the decryptor with the command - chmod 777 decrypt
- launch decryptor ./decrypt
- follow the first method of decrypting by viewing the log file: tail -f /tmp/decrypt.llg, wait for the message at the end of the log - Your system is decrypted
- the second way is to check the presence on the disk file decrypt.pid command ls, which protects the decryptor from the restart
- the third way - ps | grep decrypt, as soon as decrypt.pid will be removed from the disk, or decrypt will disappear from the running processes, decrypt is complete
- check the decrypt.llg log file and see the message at the end that the system was successfully decrypted ""Your system is decrypted""
- turn on virtual machines in ESXi

You cannot run multiple copies of a decryptor at the same time. After launching, the decryptor deletes the executable file and is demonetized, so that you cannot run the decryptor again and damage the files, this is normal.

If you have more than one ESXi host then you should not run the decryptor on all hosts simultaneously, make the decryption alternately, in the case of simultaneous operation of two decryptors may corrupt files and not be able to decrypt

If any files in another folder stay crypted, please use this command with path
Example:

"1595","25","25","138","1","1739701370","Procedure for decrypting ESXi:
- log in to vCenter
- enable ssh access to ESXi
- upload decryptor to ESXi via WinSCP or FileZilla; navigate to /tmp folder
- login to ssh with root privileges
- set permissions to run the decryptor with the command - chmod 777 decrypt
- launch decryptor ./decrypt
- follow the first method of decrypting by viewing the log file: tail -f /tmp/decrypt.llg, wait for the message at the end of the log - Your system is decrypted
- the second way is to check the presence on the disk file decrypt.pid command ls, which protects the decryptor from the restart
- the third way - ps | grep decrypt, as soon as decrypt.pid will be removed from the disk, or decrypt will disappear from the running processes, decrypt is complete
- check the decrypt.llg log file and see the message at the end that the system was successfully decrypted ""Your system is decrypted""
- turn on virtual machines in ESXi

You cannot run multiple copies of a decryptor at the same time. After launching, the decryptor deletes the executable file and is demonetized, so that you cannot run the decryptor again and damage the files, this is normal.

If you have more than one ESXi host then you should not run the decryptor on all hosts simultaneously, make the decryption alternately, in the case of simultaneous operation of two decryptors may corrupt files and not be able to decrypt

If any files in another folder stay crypted, please use this command with path
Example:

>>>>> What is the guarantee that we won't scam you? 
We are the oldest extortion gang on the planet and nothing is more important to us than our reputation. We are not a politically motivated group and want nothing but financial rewards for our work. If we defraud even one client, other clients will not pay us. In 5 years, not a single client has been left dissatisfied after making a deal with us. If you pay the ransom, we will fulfill all the terms we agreed upon during the negotiation process. Treat this situation simply as a paid training session for your system administrators, because it was the misconfiguration of your corporate network that allowed us to attack you. Our pentesting services should be paid for the same way you pay your system administrators' salaries. You can get more information about us on Elon Musk's Twitter at https://twitter.com/hashtag/lockbit?f=live.

>>>>> Warning! Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to irreversible problems with decryption of files!

>>>>> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help and don't tell anyone that we attacked you. They will forbid you from paying the ransom and will not help you in any way, you will be left with encrypted files and your business will die.

>>>>> When buying bitcoin, do not tell anyone the true purpose of the purchase. Some brokers, especially in the US, do not allow you to buy bitcoin to pay ransom. Communicate any other reason for the purchase, such as: personal investment in cryptocurrency, bitcoin as a gift, paying to buy assets for your business using bitcoin, cryptocurrency payment for consulting services, cryptocurrency payment for any other services, cryptocurrency donations, cryptocurrency donations for Donald Trump to win the election, buying bitcoin to participate in ICO and buy other cryptocurrencies, buying cryptocurrencies to leave an inheritance for your children, or any other purpose for buying cryptocurrency. Also you can use adequate cryptocurrency brokers who do not ask questions for what you buy cryptocurrency.

>>>>> After buying cryptocurrency from a broker, store the cryptocurrency on a cold wallet, such as https://electrum.org/ or any other cold cryptocurrency wallet, more details on https://bitcoin.org By paying the ransom from your personal cold cryptocurrency wallet, you will avoid any problems from regulators, police and brokers.

>>>>> Don't be afraid of any legal consequences, you were very scared, that's why you followed all our instructions, it's not your fault if you are very scared. Not a single company that paid us has had issues. Any excuses are just for insurance company to not pay on their obligation.

"1815","25","25","167","1","1739887799","Procedure for decrypting ESXi:
- log in to vCenter
- enable ssh access to ESXi
- upload decryptor to ESXi via WinSCP or FileZilla; navigate to /tmp folder
- login to ssh with root privileges
- set permissions to run the decryptor with the command - chmod 777 decrypt
- launch decryptor ./decrypt
- follow the first method of decrypting by viewing the log file: tail -f /tmp/decrypt.llg, wait for the message at the end of the log - Your system is decrypted
- the second way is to check the presence on the disk file decrypt.pid command ls, which protects the decryptor from the restart
- the third way - ps | grep decrypt, as soon as decrypt.pid will be removed from the disk, or decrypt will disappear from the running processes, decrypt is complete
- check the decrypt.llg log file and see the message at the end that the system was successfully decrypted ""Your system is decrypted""
- turn on virtual machines in ESXi

You cannot run multiple copies of a decryptor at the same time. After launching, the decryptor deletes the executable file and is demonetized, so that you cannot run the decryptor again and damage the files, this is normal.

If you have more than one ESXi host then you should not run the decryptor on all hosts simultaneously, make the decryption alternately, in the case of simultaneous operation of two decryptors may corrupt files and not be able to decrypt

If any files in another folder stay crypted, please use this command with path
Example:
./decrypt -i /tmp/files1/","0",NULL,NULL,"1","2025-02-18 14:09:59",NULL,"2025-02-18 14:10:18"

"2309","25","25","182","1","1741351896","Procedure for decrypting ESXi:
- log in to vCenter
- enable ssh access to ESXi
- upload decryptor to ESXi via WinSCP or FileZilla; navigate to /tmp folder
- login to ssh with root privileges
- set permissions to run the decryptor with the command - chmod 777 decrypt
- launch decryptor ./decrypt
- follow the first method of decrypting by viewing the log file: tail -f /tmp/decrypt.llg, wait for the message at the end of the log - Your system is decrypted
- the second way is to check the presence on the disk file decrypt.pid command ls, which protects the decryptor from the restart
- the third way - ps | grep decrypt, as soon as decrypt.pid will be removed from the disk, or decrypt will disappear from the running processes, decrypt is complete
- check the decrypt.llg log file and see the message at the end that the system was successfully decrypted ""Your system is decrypted""
- turn on virtual machines in ESXi

You cannot run multiple copies of a decryptor at the same time. After launching, the decryptor deletes the executable file and is demonetized, so that you cannot run the decryptor again and damage the files, this is normal.

If you have more than one ESXi host then you should not run the decryptor on all hosts simultaneously, make the decryption alternately, in the case of simultaneous operation of two decryptors may corrupt files and not be able to decrypt

If any files in another folder stay crypted, please use this command with path

If it does delete itself, can we re-upload and run it again without any issues?","0",NULL,NULL,"1","2025-03-07 13:56:49",NULL,"2025-03-07 14:08:51"

Though I got so much pressure from my boss to get the files back, but we simply do not have the funds to meet the current decryption price. While our team is working on transcribing printed backups into digital format, the encrypted files remain extremely valuable to us.

I would truly appreciate any further flexibility you can offer on the pricing.","0",NULL,NULL,"1","2025-03-29 03:40:48",NULL,"2025-03-29 10:17:46"

>>>>> What is the guarantee that we won't scam you?
We are the oldest extortion gang on the planet and nothing is more important to us than our reputation. We are not a politically motivated group and want nothing but financial rewards for our work. If we defraud even one client, other clients will not pay us. In 5 years, not a single client has been left dissatisfied after making a deal with us. If you pay the ransom, we will fulfill all the terms we agreed upon during the negotiation process. Treat this situation simply as a paid training session for your system administrators, because it was the misconfiguration of your corporate network that allowed us to attack you. Our pentesting services should be paid for the same way you pay your system administrators' salaries. You can get more information about us on Elon Musk's Twitter at https://twitter.com/hashtag/lockbit?f=live.

>>>>> Warning! Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to irreversible problems with decryption of files!

>>>>> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help and don't tell anyone that we attacked you. They will forbid you from paying the ransom and will not help you in any way, you will be left with encrypted files and your business will die.

>>>>> When buying bitcoin, do not tell anyone the true purpose of the purchase. Some brokers, especially in the US, do not allow you to buy bitcoin to pay ransom. Communicate any other reason for the purchase, such as: personal investment in cryptocurrency, bitcoin as a gift, paying to buy assets for your business using bitcoin, cryptocurrency payment for consulting services, cryptocurrency payment for any other services, cryptocurrency donations, cryptocurrency donations for Donald Trump to win the election, buying bitcoin to participate in ICO and buy other cryptocurrencies, buying cryptocurrencies to leave an inheritance for your children, or any other purpose for buying cryptocurrency. Also you can use adequate cryptocurrency brokers who do not ask questions for what you buy cryptocurrency.

>>>>> After buying cryptocurrency from a broker, store the cryptocurrency on a cold wallet, such as https://electrum.org/ or any other cold cryptocurrency wallet, more details on https://bitcoin.org By paying the ransom from your personal cold cryptocurrency wallet, you will avoid any problems from regulators, police and brokers.

>>>>> Don't be afraid of any legal consequences, you were very scared, that's why you followed all our instructions, it's not your fault if you are very scared. Not a single company that paid us has had issues. Any excuses are just for insurance company to not pay on their obligation.

"3199","25","25","212","1","1743859949","Procedure for decrypting ESXi:
- log in to vCenter
- enable ssh access to ESXi
- upload decryptor to ESXi via WinSCP or FileZilla; navigate to /tmp folder
- login to ssh with root privileges
- set permissions to run the decryptor with the command - chmod 777 decrypt
- launch decryptor ./decrypt
- follow the first method of decrypting by viewing the log file: tail -f /tmp/decrypt.llg, wait for the message at the end of the log - Your system is decrypted
- the second way is to check the presence on the disk file decrypt.pid command ls, which protects the decryptor from the restart
- the third way - ps | grep decrypt, as soon as decrypt.pid will be removed from the disk, or decrypt will disappear from the running processes, decrypt is complete
- check the decrypt.llg log file and see the message at the end that the system was successfully decrypted ""Your system is decrypted""
- turn on virtual machines in ESXi

You cannot run multiple copies of a decryptor at the same time. After launching, the decryptor deletes the executable file and is demonetized, so that you cannot run the decryptor again and damage the files, this is normal.

If you have more than one ESXi host then you should not run the decryptor on all hosts simultaneously, make the decryption alternately, in the case of simultaneous operation of two decryptors may corrupt files and not be able to decrypt

If any files in another folder stay crypted, please use this command with path

I am writing to you from Iran. Please believe me when I say I am not a wealthy person or part of any rich organization. I don’t have access to international banking systems, and because of global sanctions, I can’t even buy Bitcoin legally in my country.
The amount you’re asking is far beyond anything I could ever afford. Our currency has lost almost all its value — people here are struggling just to survive. Paying 5 BTC per server is not just difficult, it’s completely impossible for me. Even saving 0.1 BTC would take years here.
This situation has destroyed everything I’ve worked for. I am desperate and broken. Please understand that I’m not your enemy — I’m just a small person in a very hard place, trying to find a way forward.
If there is any way you could help, or reduce the amount, or show any mercy, I would be deeply grateful. I am willing to cooperate or discuss any possible solution that is humanly possible for me.

"3416","70","70","248","0","1744524591","Hello,

We have reviewed your request of 4 BTC, but unfortunately this is completely unrealistic for us.

We are a small company based in Turkey, and due to the current economic situation, including extreme inflation and currency devaluation, we are struggling to even cover basic operational costs. 4 BTC is equivalent to more than what our company earns in months, and it is simply not possible for us to gather such an amount.

After speaking with management and evaluating all our options, the absolute maximum we could possibly arrange is 1 BTC. Even this would require extraordinary effort and personal sacrifices from our team.

Please consider our situation. We are not a large or wealthy organization, and we are trying to recover and continue supporting our employees and customers. We hope you will be reasonable and work with us towards a solution.

Looking forward to your response.

Our currency — the Toman — has lost almost all its value. Even earning just a small amount of BTC is a nearly impossible task here.

I’m not a business owner with income in dollars or euros. I’m just an individual who has lost everything — 20 servers gone. What you’re asking for is simply beyond my means, even with a discount. If there was a way to pay in Toman, I could try to gather something, but I know it may not be useful to you.

Please, I am desperate. I’m not trying to avoid responsibility — I just need a chance to recover even part of what I’ve lost. If you can reduce the amount to something that someone like me could possibly afford, I will do everything I can to make it happen.

This is my last hope. I’m asking not as a company or target — just as a human being.","0",NULL,NULL,"1","2025-04-14 05:29:13",NULL,"2025-04-14 18:33:20"

We have already started to recover the data from these vmdk files that have not been encrypted completely through a data recovery company.

There are three situations where the suffix is incorrect. 1: The file itself is not encrypted. We can directly delete the suffix and the file can be used, or change it to the correct suffix and decrypt it without affecting its use. 2: When the encryption of a file is correct, we need to change its abnormal suffix to a normal one to decrypt it correctly. After the file is decrypted, it is normal. 3: If the file encryption process stops and the file is damaged, and we change it to a normal suffix,
 it will not be decrypted either, because the file itself is not fully encrypted and its encrypted information is incomplete, so it will not be decrypted","0",NULL,NULL,"1","2025-04-25 01:28:18",NULL,"2025-04-26 11:09:38"

There are three situations where the suffix is incorrect. 1: The file itself is not encrypted. We can directly delete the suffix and the file can be used, or change it to the correct suffix and decrypt it without affecting its use. 2: When the encryption of a file is correct, we need to change its abnormal suffix to a normal one to decrypt it correctly. After the file is decrypted, it is normal. 3: If the file encryption process stops and the file is damaged, and we change it to a normal suffix,
it will not be decrypted either, because the file itself is not fully encrypted and its encrypted information is incomplete, so it will not be decrypted ","0",NULL,NULL,"1","2025-04-26 11:10:03",NULL,"2025-04-26 11:16:38"
